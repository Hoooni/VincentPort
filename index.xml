      <description>Based on the Iowa Caucus rise, if Buttigieg is chosen as the Democratic presidential candidate, he should focus more on three following areas for his speeches in upcoming primaries and debates with Trump:
First, the speech should focus more on the brevity and the substance of the words. Second, it is important to exclude overlapping terms with Trump and to select and reiterate important key words. Third, if there is any performance related expression that is emphasized by Trump in the word bundle, it should be prepared to strike back on objective grounds.</description>

      <description>For this first group project, I built a web analytics frame using R to analyze website to improve sales. This case study was from Columbia Business School case works and I and my team analyzed the data using R. My R code can be read in Github repository.
 Pain Point : Incapable of developing a website that generates consumer interest, builds customer retention, and furthers brand recognition Findings :  5% average of visitors convert to customers decline to 3% of potential visitors in promo period 38% traffic increase in post-promo period Weight of alloy sold during promo declined by 24.</description>

      <description>For this first project I built a python text game to check various points using game format. Using a main conceptual framework such as loop, printing, conditional statetment, nested function gamer can get the useful information before their first visit to DMV.
 Pain Point : Too simple or complicated to make a checklist Solution : Make text game to memorize the important things      Link to Github Repository</description>
